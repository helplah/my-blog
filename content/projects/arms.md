##Problem##
ARMS help ThoughtWorks Singapore manage housing leases
to foreign employees who travel to Singapore for projects.

Client was using spreadsheet until we built a centralised
system to allocate occupants to apartments and vice versa.
Client can now easily generate reports and track expenses

##Solution##
Since we only had about 3 weeks to finish it, we had to focus on the necessary features for MVP. Our MVP allow the user to create apartments and occupants, and allocate occupants to apartments and vice versa.

###Accomplishments###
