### Code Log #6 - 26-08-2019

---

#### Plan for the day

- Finish LinkedList
- Finish multivalued dependency question
- Finish SQL trigger question

#### To investigate

- Why would array deletion complexity be O(N)? If an element is deleted in the front, do all elements have to shift left? If yes, why do all elements have to shift left - isn't the allocated space enough for the array?

#### Learned today

- Queue:

| Algorithm | Average | Worst Case |
| :-------: | :-----: | :--------: |
|  Access   |  O(N)   |    O(N)    |
|  Search   |  O(N)   |    O(N)    |
|  Insert   |  O(1)   |    O(1)    |
|  Delete   |  O(1)   |    O(1)    |

- Array:

| Algorithm | Average | Worst Case |
| :-------: | :-----: | :--------: |
|  Access   |  O(1)   |    O(1)    |
|  Search   |  O(N)   |    O(N)    |
|  Insert   |  O(N)   |    O(N)    |
|  Delete   |  O(N)   |    O(N)    |

#### Done today

- Did LinkedList halfway through - took me about 2.5 hours. I was stuck at pop() for very long, still left push(), getSize(), getAt(), insertAt(), removeAt().
- [x] Finish SQL trigger question

#### Plan for tomorrow

- Finish ICT330 TMA01 qn 2 - multivalued dependency, BCNF
- Finish ICT330 TMA01 qn 5 - SQL checkpoint, isolation, recovery
- Finish Linked List
