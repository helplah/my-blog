### Codelog #1 - 30-07-2019

---

#### Plan for the day

- Apartment profile

#### To investigate

- git reflog vs log

#### Learned today

- `git add -N` moves a file from untracked to unstaged
- `git add -p` checks if files in staging are ready to be committed by asking you to look at hunk of changes one by one
- `git diff` compares the difference of files in staging (I think?)

#### Done today

- [x] CSS styling

#### Resource list
