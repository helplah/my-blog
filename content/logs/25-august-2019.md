### Code Log #5 - 25-08-2019

#### Plan for the day

- Finish MySQL views and join table questions
- Finish CircularLengthQueue
- Finish LinkedList

#### To investigate

- Basically the checkAmount trigger below is supposed to print 1 if the previous bill entry exists, or else it should print 2. However, statement 2 doesn't work - it keeps using the current amount for the previous total, even when I made sure to specify which table is should be with `b.amount` (b is an alias for Bill table).

```
1.
Previous Total $45 // if it finds the previous total amount
Current Amount $45
Total Amount $90
```

OR

```
2.
Previous Total $0 // if it doesn't find the previous total amount
Current Amount $45
Total Amount $45
```

```
CREATE TRIGGER checkAmount
ON Bill
AFTER INSERT
AS
	DECLARE @previousTotal NUMERIC (5,2)
	DECLARE @currentAmount NUMERIC (5,2)
	DECLARE @date DATETIME
	DECLARE @staffId CHAR(6)
	DECLARE @childBirthOrder INT
	DECLARE @clinicNo INT
BEGIN
	SELECT
	@currentAmount = amount,
	@date = dateVisit,
	@staffId = staffId,
	@childBirthOrder = childBirthOrder,
	@clinicNo = clinicNo
	FROM INSERTED;

	-- I can't get b.amount when entry doesn't exist, it keeps showing the insertion amount
	SELECT @previousTotal = b.amount
	FROM Bill b
	WHERE YEAR(@date) = YEAR(b.dateVisit)
	AND MONTH(@date) = MONTH(b.dateVisit)
	AND @staffId = b.staffId
	AND @childBirthOrder= b.childBirthOrder
	AND @clinicNo = b.clinicNo;

	PRINT 'Previous Total $' + cast(@previousTotal as varchar)
	PRINT 'Current Amount $' + cast(@currentAmount as varchar)
	PRINT 'Total Amount $' + cast(@previousTotal + @currentAmount as varchar)
	IF @previousTotal + @currentAmount > 100
	BEGIN
		PRINT 'Current bill is rejected because total amount exceeds $100 for month of ' +
			cast(DATENAME(month, @date) as varchar) + ' for year ' + cast(YEAR(@date) as varchar)
		ROLLBACK
	END
	ELSE
	BEGIN
		PRINT 'Current bill is approved'
	END
END
```
