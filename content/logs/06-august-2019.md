#### To investigate

- Mongoose populate lets you "reference documents in other collections. "Population is the process of automatically replacing the specified paths in the document with document(s) from other collection(s)."

#### Learned today

- Gold Master Testing is used mostly to refactor complex legacy codebase because these systems usually have little to no test coverage. Before refactoring you need to write tests to ensure you don't break anything...

That's where Gold Master Testing comes in. It is concerned with ensuring the consistency of output, so the same input should return the same output - kind of like functional programming.

The only way to have confidence in Gold Master Testing is to provide a variety of input data set, you should introduce as much edge case data as possible in order to cover the maximum amount of scenarios.
