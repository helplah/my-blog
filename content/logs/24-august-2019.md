### Code Log #4 - 24-08-2019

---

#### Plan for the day

- Finish MySQL views and join table questions
- Finish CircularLengthQueue
- Finish LinkedList

#### To investigate

- How to write more complex SQL logic

#### Learned today

- SQL `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` refers to left outer join and right outer join. However, SQL `JOIN` refers to inner join while `FULL JOIN` refers to outer join.

- To print `datetime` data type in SQL requires you to cast it with `cast(DATENAME(month, @date) as varchar)` or `cast(YEAR(@date) as varchar)`. SQL does not coerce the data type for you when you print it. Conclusion: SQL probably does not coerce other data types too when you print them.

#### Done today

- [x] Finish MySQL views and join table questions

#### Plan for tomorrow

- Finish CircularLengthQueue
- Finish LinkedList
