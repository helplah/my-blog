JumpStart Week 2 (27 - 31 May 2019)

This week we focused on:
JavaScript in depth
Testing with Jest
Test driven development (TDD)

I practised JS arrays methods like map and filter, objects etc. How to write in ES6 etc. Promise, async/await.

javascript-basics
javascript-exercises
promise-shop

I also learnt a testing framework called Jest. We used assertions like test, xtest, it, xit, test.only(), test.skip() etc. We learnt mocks, spies and jest.fn().

jest-starter-template
tdd-with-jest
mummifier-exercise
mocks-demo
mocks-and-stubs-lab

We deleted our code for previously completed mummifier exercise, and re-do it with TDD way. It was hard, to be honest I struggled and found it very distracting to keep writing test for my code. After that we pair programmed and did kata.

Queues kata

  - need to wrap Link and Route inside Router component
  - component={ToDoList}, render={props => <ToDoList {...props} />}

* react-weather-app
* react-todo-list which became my project on the fourth week

The traditional way of doing it is also Server-side rendering (Netflix isomorpheric).

Current popular way is front-end and back-end separation - which is like a hybrid of CSR and SSR.

Client-side rendering where react-router becomes even more important if we have multiple pages and we want to use the library to give the illusion that the url is changing.
