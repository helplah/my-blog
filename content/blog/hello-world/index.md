Hi I'm Jenssen! I've created this blog dedicated for programming and technical problems I've faced.
This is my first post and serves as an introduction on what I want to do!

I have another blog on wordpress for non-technical matters, I was wondering if I should combine them together. Time will tell!

That's it for now. I'll write about the problems I faced with development and deployment of ShopLah in the next post!

Note to self: this [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) will come in handy!
