Recently someone spoke to me on Tandem, a language learning app, and asked for help. He wanted me to help him build authentication for a travel website. He offered to pay me SGD $14 per hour OR SGD $20 per hour for up to 10 hours a week. I knew something was up but still decided to go along with it. From the beginning, I should have told him about my experience even though he said he knew.

First of all, I have no idea how he found me.

Secondly, I'm not sure if he has found the right person. What I should have done is set and manage his expectations of me. Setting up the environment and familiarising with the codebase takes time. Not to mentioned, when I first ran the code it wasn't working; I had to fix two bugs to get it running - that itself took some time. However, in his mind, these probably shouldn't take that much time. **I have to constantly mention what I did and how long it took.**

Maybe I'm not as good at programming as he thinks lol.

He wants to hire -->
