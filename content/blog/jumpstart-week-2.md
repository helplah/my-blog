This week we focused on:
JavaScript in depth
Testing with Jest
Test driven development (TDD)

I practised JS arrays methods like map and filter, objects etc. How to write in ES6 etc. Promise, async/await.

javascript-exercises
promise-shop

I also learnt a testing framework called Jest. We used assertions like test, xtest, it, xit, test.only(), test.skip() etc. We learnt mocks, spies and jest.fn().

We deleted our code for previously completed mummifier exercise, and re-do it with TDD way. It was hard, to be honest I struggled and found it very distracting to keep writing test for my code. After that we pair programmed and did kata.
